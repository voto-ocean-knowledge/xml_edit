# xml_edit
Edit xml files for ERDDAP datasets

These scripts manage the datasets.xml file for the [VOTO ERDDAP](https://erddap.observations.voiceoftheocean.org/erddap/index.html). This drastically reduces the workload of adding datasets to the ERDDAP.

The most techinical code is in **correct_xml.py**. This file deals with reading, checking, writing and managing xml.

Do not run, **correct_xml.py** directly. It depends on initial xml generated by ERDDAP's `GenerateDatasetsXml`. This funciton is called by the shell scripts **add_dataset**.

These shell scripts can be run from the command line to process one dataset at a time, or the **add_all** python files can be used to check all datasets and update them if they have changed on disk.
